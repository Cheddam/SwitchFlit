## Premise

Quick-Switcher UIs are super useful for power users, and available today in a variety of applications and forms, such as Slack, Sublime Text, and Spotlight. With SwitchFlit, you can specify a DataObject's Name and Link fields and immediately enable a basic Quick-Switcher in your web app.

## Installation / Configuration

`composer require cheddam/silverstripe-switchflit`

See the [installation guide](docs/en/installation.md) for basic setup.

## Technologies Used

SwitchFlit uses [Vue](https://vuejs.org) to power its UI, assisted by [Fuse.js](http://fusejs.io) for fuzzy-search.
