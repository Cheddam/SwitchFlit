## [1.0.0 Beta 1](https://github.com/Cheddam/SwitchFlit/tree/1.0.0-beta.1) (2016-10-01)

Welcome to the first beta build! Some major strides have been made since 0.9, and we are well on track to hitting 1.0 by the end of October.

- Added `WithCustomQuery` interface to allow custom filtering and other behaviour on records (see new docs)
- Added switching between results (use the arrow keys!)
- Added testing, linting, shrinkwrapping and editorconfig to keep things ship-shape
- Improved namespacing consistency
- Improved error handling and display across front- and back-end
- Improved global hotkey (now tentatively supports iOS devices and only becomes available when SwitchFlit is ready)
- Fixed inconsistent licensing
